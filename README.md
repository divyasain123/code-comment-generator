## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### 🧩 Challenge 1: Data Scarcity & Collection

* **Problem**: GitHub API rate limits + parsing complexity
* **Solution**: Hand-curated 15 diverse examples to demonstrate concept efficacy

### ⚙️ Challenge 2: Attention Mechanism Complexity

* **Problem**: Implementing and debugging tensor shapes
* **Solution**: Built modular attention layers with careful broadcasting

```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
    weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return torch.matmul(weights, V)
```

### 🧪 Challenge 3: Overfitting

* **Problem**: High training accuracy but poor generalization
* **Solution**: Early stopping, regularization, gradient clipping
